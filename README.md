## About <a name = "about"></a>

Project CineMAC is a network analysis project that aims to study the influence, trends and patterns of cinematic production through the creation and analysis of a network of film citations, and a corresponding network consisting of various film agents. Unlike previous studies that failed to stress the domination of the USA cinematic industry in the available data, our project addresses the power asymmetries underlying the present westernised vision of cinematic history, undermining the role of East-Asian artistic influence.

 ## Data
The projectâ€™s data is acquired by the Internet Movie Database, which provides datasets in tab-separated values format, freely accessible on their dedicated website for personal and non commercial use.
